    <div class="first_words">“As it was” is the first look at Harry’s upcoming album “Harry’s House” which is scheduled to be released on 20 May 2022 by Columbia and Erskine Records. The record was released on April 1st and is already considered to be the song of summer 2022.</div>

  <div class="second_text">
    <div class="second_number">2.</div>
    <div class="second_words">The opening of the video is very sweet as it starts with the audio of a voice mail, which was left to Harry by his little god daughter. He said she called him every night before bed time and one time, when he appearently wasn’t around,  he was left with a precious message. <br>He tried it in the song and stuck with it.</div>

<div class="third" id="4">
  <div class="third_text">
    <div class="third_number">3.</div>
    <div class="third_words">The colortone of the video is impeccable. It brightens up with red and blue as the charectare’s costumes show up possibly referencing a central metaphor in "The Matrix." Neo is offered a choice between a blue pill and a red pill. The former represents blissful ignorance, while the latter represents painful truth. In this context, we can assume that Styles wants to "take the blue pill." He continues to pine for his lover, choosing to ignore how they've grown apart.</div>

    <div class="fourth_words">Harry is known for his love of art and was captured many times at various galeries all over the world. In “As it was” music video he refers to Charles and Ray Eames, the married couple who were influential industrial designers. <br> The picture of them lying in their studio is recreated in the video. </div>

<div class="fifth" id="6">
  <div class="fifth_text">
    <div class="fifth_number">5.</div>
    <div class="fifth_words">The song creates a sense of detachment and loneliness.
But it’s not a heavy feeling of sorrow. It is a light thing of letting go. Harry talks about love in a valnurable and honest, yet poetic way. As he always does.</div>
